     return (
       <ToastProvider>

   }
   ```

2. Import the Solid Notifications css file into your main css file:

   /* index.css */

   @import "solid-notifications/index.css";
   ```

3. Create toasts:

   ```tsx
   import { useToast } from "solid-notifications";

   export default function AppContent() {
     const { notify } = useToast();

     return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={() => notify("ðŸš€ New toast ready to serve!")}>
           Create a Toast!
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   or

   ```tsx
