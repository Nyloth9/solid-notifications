# Components

Solid Notifications provides several key components to manage and display notifications. {{ "class": "lead" }}

## ToastProvider {{"data-nav": "link", "class": "text-blue-500", "id": "toastprovider"}}

### `<ToastProvider />`

The ToastProvider is a context provider component that manages the state and functionality of toasters within your application. It serves as the central hub for registering, retrieving, and unregistering toasters, as well as providing configuration options for toast notifications.

Wrap your application (or a specific part of it) with the ToastProvider to enable toast functionality. This component should be placed at a high level in your component tree to ensure that all child components have access to the toast context.

<Code lang="tsx">

```tsx
import { ToastProvider } from "solid-notifications";

export default function App(props) {
  return <ToastProvider>{props.children}</ToastProvider>;
}
```

</Code>

### Props

The ToastProvider accepts [all the config props](/random) and `children`.

- #### Global Props and Propagation

       Props set on the `ToastProvider` are global and apply to all toasters and toasts within its context. These global settings propagate down to individual toasters and toasts, ensuring consistent behavior and styling across your application.

- #### Reactive Props

       The `ToastProvider` also accepts reactive props. This means you can pass SolidJS signals or derived values as props, and they will dynamically update the global configuration. For example, if you want to change the toast position or theme dynamically based on user preferences, you can pass a signal as the position prop.

<HighlightBlock type="info">
  **Local Overrides**: Individual Toasters or Toasts can override global
  settings. For example, if a specific toast needs a longer duration, you can
  set a duration directly on that toast, and it will take precedence over the
  global setting.
</HighlightBlock>

## Toaster {{"data-nav": "link", "class": "text-blue-500", "id": "toaster"}}

### `<Toaster />`

The Toaster component is responsible for rendering and managing a collection of toasts. It acts as a container for toasts, handling their lifecycle, positioning, and behavior based on global and local configuration settings. Each `Toaster` instance is registered with the `ToastProvider` and can be uniquely identified by its `toasterId`.

<Code lang="tsx">

```tsx
import { Toaster } from "solid-notifications";

export default function App(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <Toaster toasterId="primary" />
      <Toaster toasterId="secondary" />
      {props.children}
    </>
  );
}
```

</Code>

- **Multiple Toaster Support**: Allows you to create multiple toasters, each with its own configuration settings. {{ "class": "compact" }}

- **Toast Management**: Manages a queue of toasts and renders them based on configuration settings like limit and reverseToastOrder. {{ "class": "compact" }}

- **Dynamic Positioning**: Automatically calculates and updates toast positions based on their height, gutter spacing, and offset. {{ "class": "compact" }}

- **Window Visibility Handling**: Pauses toast progress when the window is inactive (blurred) and resumes when the window is active (focused), depending on configuration. {{ "class": "compact" }}

- **Reactive Configuration**: Supports reactive updates to its configuration, which propagate to all toasts within the toaster. {{ "class": "compact" }}

### Props

The Toaster component accepts [all the config props](/random) and `toasterId`.

<HighlightBlock type="warning">
  **Multiple Toasters**: If you use multiple toasters, each toaster must be
  provided with a unique `toasterId` and toast functions must be called with a
  `toasterId` prop to target the correct toaster (exceptions apply to specific
  functions).
</HighlightBlock>

    1.  **Required Props**

            - `toasterId`: required if you have multiple toasters. It uniquely identifies the toaster instance and is used to register and retrieve the toaster from the ToastProvider.

    2.  **Toaster and ToastProvider only props**
        These props can override the global settings provided by the ToastProvider:

                - `limit` - The maximum number of toasts to display at once. Excess toasts are queued and rendered when space becomes available.

                - `reverseToastOrder` - If true, toasts are rendered in reverse order (newest at the top/bottom).

                - `offsetX` - Horizontal offset for the toaster's position.

                - `offsetY` - Vertical offset for the toaster's position.

                - `gutter` - Spacing between toasts.

                - `positionX` - Horizontal positioning of the toaster ("left", "center", "right").

                - `positionY` - Vertical positioning of the toaster ("top", "bottom").

                - `renderOnWindowInactive` - If true, toasts will render even when the window is inactive (blurred).

                - `pauseOnWindowInactive` - If true, toast progress will pause when the window is inactive (blurred).

                - `toasterStyle` - Custom styles for the toaster container.

    3.  **Shared props**
        Can be applied to all components; `ToastProvider`, `Toaster` and `Toast`.

## Toast {{"data-nav": "link", "class": "text-blue-500", "id": "toast"}}

### `class Toast`

The Toast class represents an individual notification message. They are invoked by the provided functions and rendered within a Toaster instance. Each toast can be customized with various options like content, duration, and appearance.

<Code lang="tsx">

```tsx
import { useToast } from "solid-notifications";

export default function App() {
  const { notify } = useToast();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        notify({
          content: "Hello, World!",
          duration: 5000,
          type: "success",
          exitCallback: (reason) =>
            console.log(`Toast exited because: ${reason}`),
        })
      }
    >
      Show Toast
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Code>

- **Customizable Content**: Supports custom content, including text, HTML, or JSX elements. {{ "class": "compact" }}
- **Appearance Options**: Supports various appearance options like type, icon, and theme. {{ "class": "compact" }}
- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: Provides callbacks for toast lifecycle events like onEnter, onExit, and exitCallback. {{ "class": "compact" }}
- **Reactive Configuration**: Supports reactive updates to its configuration. {{ "class": "compact" }}
- **Global and Local Overrides**: Overrides global settings provided by the ToastProvider or Toaster. {{ "class": "compact" }}
